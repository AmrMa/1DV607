Below are the most important points that we changed from the last submission, and these changes are based on peer reviews:
1- Names of classes are sometimes in small letters and other times capital letters[Fixed]. 
2-We should not use the + sign beside our attributes because it has more to do with implementation rather than domain modeling[fixed].
3- We should have a revision history and fees conceptual classes [fixed].
4-Replacing our arrows with lines instead of arrows[fixed].
